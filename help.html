  <h2>CSS</h2>
  <p>
    I didn't use any sort of CSS framework, library, or template so everything is my custom rules. <br/>
    1. Clearly the backgrounds are not white<br/>
    2. My h1's and h2's are custom headers<br/>
    3. My navigation bar has custom colors<br/>
    4. My navigation bar uses 3 anchor tags with custom links<br/>
    5. The main application has a red border<br/>
    6. The help page headings clearly have a font style change<br/>
    7. Also by looking around the page it's pretty clear that I changed a lot of CSS, it may be ugly but it is custom, as per the requirements.<br/>
  </p>
  <h2>How to use the application</h2>
  <p>
    <b>Creating Baskets</b> <br/>
    This is done very simply using the left menu buttons to add, create, remove, confirm goodies. There are also preconfigured options.<br/>
    <b>Undo/Redo</b><br/>
    The application allows virtually unlimited undo/redo while you're on the creation page, but is not saved after you leave the page (for example, to go to the file management page).<br/>
    <b>Save Format</b><br/>
    The baskets are saved as arrays of 13 integers. 1-12 are the goodies (0=nothing, 1=white egg, 2=blue egg, 3=striped egg, 4=chocolate bunny). The 13th integer is the basket color (0=brown, 1=white). These are stored in simple plain text files as strings (for example, [2,3,2,3,2,3,4,4,4,3,0,0,1]).<br/>
  </p>
  <h2>Extensions</h2>
  <p>
    <b>5 pts: 1a. Style using a CSS feature not discussed in class </b> <br/>
    I made the buttons tilt when hovered over using an animation. I learned a lot about CSS animations in my internship last summer which is how I knew how to do this. <br/>

    <b> 5pts: 1b. Make a fancy page background </b> <br/>
    I created a color-changing page background by making a large static gradient and using animations to move the image back and forth,
    making the color change. <br/>

    <b> 5pts: 2b. Delete row </b><br/>
    Added a button which removes the current row<br/>

    <b> 5pts: 3a. Make 3 more baskets or goodies available </b><br/>
    Added red, green, and blue baskets, selectable under the "change basket" button <br/>
